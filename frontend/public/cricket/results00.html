<tr><td rowspan=2>17 May <td> Ad Lib XI<td>59 all out<td rowspan=2> This match
was restricted to 16 overs a side (3 overs max per bowler) due to rain, and the
University Open Day restricted the availability of players.
Biology won the toss and batted making 77 for 5, David Murrell making
35 of those (not out).<br>
Ad Lib only had a team of 8 players but they got off to a good start (38/1
off 4) with Mendham making a rapid 31 but Ad Lib were then restricted by some
fine bowling by Lisa Emberson (3 overs; 5 runs; 2 wickets) and were bowled
out for 59 in the 13th over.

<tr><td rowspan=2>24 May <td><b>All Out Chemists</b><td>63-5<td rowspan=2>
Chemistry won the toss and put IRISS into bat. The bowling attack ensured
that only 20 runs were scored from the first 8 overs, and the scoring remained
low as the wickets fell.  Chemistry's reply started very poorly with three
wickets falling for just 3 runs after 4 overs.  The middle order were more
effective, and a winning total was reached in the 16th over.
