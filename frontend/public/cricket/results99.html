<tr><td rowspan=2>12 May <td><b>Ad Lib</b><td> <td rowspan=2> Ad Lib win by
about 50 runs. 
<tr><td> Politics<td> 

<tr><td rowspan=2>14 May <td> All Out Chemists<td>78-5<td rowspan=2> Chemistry
batted first but couldn't make a big total, Jan Heaton got 4 wickets, 2 ct and
bowled.  The IRISS-PDP batsmen drew level on the penultimate ball, and then
failed to score anything off the last,
but had a wicket in hand.  A good start for the `new' IRISS-PDP collaboration.
<tr><td><b>IRISS - PDPII<b><td>78-4

<tr><td rowspan=2>19 May <td><b>Physical Wrecks</b><td>113-6<td rowspan=2> A
steady performance from the Wrecks, setting a target rate which Biology could not
quite keep up with.  Full report <a href="19may99.html">available here</a>.
<tr><td> Biology<td> 104-5

<tr><td rowspan=2>21 May <td> Economics<td>57 all out<td rowspan=2> Smith &amp; Nephew
batted a respectable total, with A. Fray getting 60*.  Tight bowling from Simon
Smith for Economics.  Economics were bowled out, Alan Duncan the only high
scorer with 21. Fray with his wrist spin got 3 wkts just for 1 run: 2-1-1-3                 
a clear man of the match.
<tr><td><b>Smith &amp; Nephew Research</b><td> 108-6

<tr><td rowspan=2>26 May <td> IRISS - PDPII<td>120-6<td rowspan=2> Ad Lib only
fielded 10 men, IRISS-PDP had 12 so offered Roy Hadden to even up the numbers.
(This was the evening of Man Utd. v. Bayern Munich).  Ad Lib batted first and
made 130, a pretty good total.  IRISS-PDP replied well and with two overs to
go they needed 15 runs to win, with 8 wickets in hand.
John Heath, as a gesture to Roy for turning out for
them offers him the penultimate over.  He bowls and takes 4 wickets in 5 balls! 
IRISS lose by 10 runs.
Much animated discussion ensued, but there's nothing in the rules
about who can play for a team so the result will stand.
<tr><td><b>Ad Lib</b><td> 130-?

<tr><td rowspan=2>28 May <td> Politics<td>143-5<td rowspan=2> Politics batted first and
scored a good total, including an 89* and 30-odd from Finlayson.
Chemistry attacked well, Peter O'Brien finding a few boundaries before he was tempted to
drive leading to a catch behind.
John McGrady 100*
(a maiden century, and only the second chemist to reach 3 figures in 25 years). 
Mike Anderson stayed with John
farming the strike.  The winning runs came with 2 overs to spare.
<tr><td><b>All Out Chemists</b><td> 144-1

<tr><td rowspan=2>2 June <td> Smith &amp; Nephew Research<td> <td rowspan=2>
Rained off, rescheduled for 15th July.
<tr><td> Biology<td> 

<tr><td rowspan=2>4 June <td> Physical Wrecks<td> <td rowspan=2> Postponed until
29 July.
<tr><td> Economics<td> 

<tr><td rowspan=2>9 June <td> Ad Lib<td>89-4<td rowspan=2> A brave 8 chemists took to the field
and were quickly down to 7 as Simon Watson was taken to hospital for a dislocated/broken finger
going for a catch. However, captain Peter O'Brien had done everything right     
from winning the toss, juggling 5 bowlers and field placings. Backed up by good
bowling, Ad Lib were restricted to 89-4 off their 20 overs.  An opening stand of 55
between Jim Brannigan and Ashley Pike dispelled any fears of a collapse,
and the runs were made with 6 overs and wickets to spare.  Pike 75*.
<tr><td><b>All Out Chemists</b><td> 90-4?

<tr><td rowspan=2>11 June <td> Politics<td>85 All Out<td rowspan=2> New skipper Heaton
won the toss for IRISS/PDP, put Politics in to bat first. Great bowling and
good catches kept the score down.  IRISS/PDP knocked off the runs fairly easily.
<tr><td><b>IRISS - PDPII</b><td>86?-2
 
<tr><td rowspan=2>16 June <td><b>Physical Wrecks</b><td>148-4<td rowspan=2>
S&amp;N got a big total but the Wrecks went chasing with a positive attitude,
scored off everything, and won with 2 balls to spare.  Certainly the biggest
score for us in recent years.  Full report <a href="16jun99.html">available
here</a>.
<tr><td> Smith &amp; Nephew Research<td> 144-7

<tr><td rowspan=2>18 June <td><b>Biology</b><td>125 all out<td rowspan=2>
Put into bat by Economics, Biology                                                                        
were immediately under pressure after a couple of wickets fell quickly. A     
quickfire 17 by newcomer Sean Simpson and a magnificent 58 from 38 balls from 
David Vaughan looked to set Biology up for a big total but sadly only minor
contributions from the rest of the order meant the innings closed at 125 all out.
Economics, needing a reachable 126 runs, were always under pressure from tight
Biology bowling. A steady stream of wickets kept the score in check, with
Duncan, who opened the batting, scoring a creditable 42. Economics ended their
innings at 106 for 6, with Nongthomba's legspin taking 3/19.
<tr><td> Economics<td> 106-6

<tr><td rowspan=2>28 June <td> Biology<td> <td rowspan=2> Postponed to 2 July.
<tr><td> Politics<td>

<tr><td rowspan=2>29 June <td> Physical Wrecks<td>61 all out<td rowspan=2> 
A rather one-sided battle between two under-strength sides. Ad Lib were kept to
a reasonable score of 96, but then their bowlers tore through the Wrecks' batting.
Gory details <a href="29jun99.html">available here</a>.
<tr><td><b>Ad Lib</b><td> 96-3 

<tr><td rowspan=2>30 June <td><b>Smith &amp; Nephew Research</b><td>140ish<td rowspan=2> 
IRISS-PDP won the toss and elected to field; S&amp;N attacked from the start and
racked up a fine score, 50+ for Houldridge.  IRISS-PDP had a good go at matching
the run rate, but couldn't quite keep up, finishing about 10 runs short.
<tr><td> IRISS - PDPII<td>130ish 

<tr><td rowspan=2>1 July <td> Economics<td>65 all out<td rowspan=2> 
Chemistry held to a reasonable score in spite of the efforts of Large (29),
Anderson (23) and Pike (22).  The Chemistry bowling attack saw two wickets each
for O'Brien, Hardy and Large, and a first wicket for Wilson K.
<tr><td><b>All Out Chemists</b><td> 99-6

<tr><td rowspan=2>2 July <font size=-1>(from 28 June)</font><td><b>Biology</b><td>112?<td rowspan=2>
Politics batted first and looked to be set for a reasonable
total with some intelligent batting from opener Roe. Biology, for the second  
match in succession bowled tightly but struggled to make a breakthrough. After
a change in the bowling attack, Roberts with his decieving flight took a much 
needed wicket at one end, with Maitland taking two in quick succession at the 
other. Politics then struggled to 111 for 4, with Roe falling to Vaughan in the                                                                            
final over. Biology, after a farcical start (Simpson run out with out facing a
ball) lost three quick wickets but recovered well with Simon Hardy carrying his                                                                            
bat finishing on 58 no. The total was reached with over three overs to spare.

<tr><td rowspan=2>7 July <td><b>All Out Chemists<b><td>150-3<td rowspan=2> A huge
score for these two teams, with Chemistry coming out on top.  N&amp;N went first
and set a good target, 60 for Morgan.  Chemistry chased until they needed 7 from the last over.
Pike hit a 6 and finished it with a cheeky single.  Pike 106*, Anderson 24.

Chemistry brought their 
season to a succesful conclusion, although not without some scares.
Chemistry won the toss and elected to field. Biology's openers, 	     
Hardy and Upprenda got them off to a good start, 30 off 6 overs        
before the first wicket fell. Davies and Large bowled tightly for
Chemistry and Pike then came on to maintain the grip but the score
ticked over, 52-2 off 10 overs became 107-6 after 20 overs.
Chemistry openers Pike and Anderson put on 63 in the first 10 overs. Biology then
brought back their opener who was really quick and he disposed of
Pike for 60? just after Anderson had been run out for 25. He also
clean bowled Davies in the same over and it was left to Large to knock
off the winning runs in the 16th over.
<tr><td><b>All Out Chemists</b><td> 108-3

<tr><td rowspan=2>21 July <td><b>IRISS - PDPII</b><td>86-3<td rowspan=2>
The Wrecks were held to a lowish score by a varied bowling attack, then the
