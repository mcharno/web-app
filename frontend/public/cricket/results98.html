  <tr><th>Date<th>&nbsp;<th>Score<th>Comments

<tr><td rowspan=2>Wed 13&nbsp;May <td><b>Ad Lib</b><td>85-0 <td rowspan=2>Wellings got 44 of the PDP runs, Howard and M&nbsp;Evans on 33* and 34* for Ad Lib.  Ad Lib bowling reckoned to be good.
<tr><td> Briggs PDP11<td>84 all out
<tr><td rowspan=2>Fri 15&nbsp;May <td><b>All Out Chemists</b><td>35-0<td rowspan=2>IRISS rolled up with only 8 men and elected to bat in the hope someone else would turn up.  Galloway 17*, Heaton run out in a mix up, a full side might have done quite well.  Griffin, O'Brien, Lewis, Duckett and Hardy a useful bowling line up for Chemistry.  Chemistry openers Hardy and McVey both 17*.
<tr><td> IRISS Zingari<td>34-7 (all out)
<tr><td rowspan=2>Wed 20&nbsp;May <td><b>Physical Wrecks</b><td>79-1<td rowspan=2>A strong performance from the Wrecks, useful additions to the team for this season.  Full report <a href="20may98.html">available here.</a>
<tr><td> Biology<td>78-8
<tr><td rowspan=2>Fri 22&nbsp;May <td> Random Distribution<td>-<td rowspan=2> Rained off, declared no-result.
<tr><td> Smith &amp; Nephew GRC<td>-
<tr><td rowspan=2>Wed 27&nbsp;May <td> IRISS Zingari<td>121-5<td rowspan=2> Both sides were short of a player so the batsmen took advantage of gaps in the field.

<tr><td><b>Ad Lib</b><td>144-6
<tr><td rowspan=2>Fri 29&nbsp;May <td> Briggs PDP11<td>90-4<td rowspan=2> PDP11 batted first and scored very slowly for the first 11 overs, losing 4 wickets for 20.  Thereafter, a strong fightback from Audsley and Watkinson gave a creditable final score.  Chemistry replied with a strong batting lineup, winning in 14 overs.  <a href="league_29may98.html">Detailed report here.</a>
