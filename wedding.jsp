            <h6>The Merchant Adventurers' Hall, York</h6>
            <h6>4pm to late</h6>

            <h3>The Couple</h3>
            <p>Jill and Michael meet [insert funny story] and then [insert other mildly funny story].  Then they fell in love and are now getting married.</p>

            <h3>The Venue</h3>
            <img src="resources/images/wedding/mah.jpg" class="right" id="image-mah" />
            <p id="venue">Set in beautiful gardens in the centre of historic York, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_Adventurers'_Hall">Merchant Adventurers' Hall</a> is a medieval guildhall built over 650 years ago. There are three main rooms in the Hall: the Great Hall where the Medieval merchants first gathered to conduct business and to socialise. The Undercroft which was used as an alms house to help the sick and the poor and the Chapel offering spiritual care.</p>
            <p>The venue does have a ban stilleto style heels (any heel smaller than a 5 pence coin or a dime) on the main floor where the wedding cermony will take place.  However, you can wear heel caps over the offending heels, of which some will be provided to our guests.  Please let us know if you require them and we will ensure we have a pair for you.  Likewise, you can buy heel caps at the venue on the day for a fee.</p>

            <h3>Things to do</h3>
            <p></p>

            <h3>Getting Here</h3>
            <h5>Air</h5>
            <p>If you're coming by air the most convenient international airport is <strong>Manchester Airport</strong> [MAN].  There is a train that runs from the airport to York that only takes 1 hour 45 mins and costs about &pound;30 for a round trip ticket.</p>
            <p>The closest airport to York is <strong>Leeds Bradford</strong> [LBA], and has regular flights from Amsterdam.  Getting to and from Leeds Bradford from York though requires a bus into Leeds and then a train ride or another bus to York.  It is close enough to take a taxi as well, which will cost around &pound;45 one way.  If you have 4 people this will probably be cheaper per person than the train from Manchester airport.</p>
            <p>The <strong>London airports</strong> (Heathrow [LHR], Stansted [STN] &amp; Gatwick [LGW]) also have many international flights but can be awkward to get to York from.  Since none of them are actually in the city, you'll need to get a train or shuttle back in to the city, and then a train ticket up to York which can be much more expensive.  If you plan on visiting London anyways this is probably a better option.</p>
            <h5>Rail</h5>
            <p>York is well serviced by British rail and is on the main north-south line between London and Edinburgh.  The best place look at timetables, check prices, and buy tickets is the <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk">National Rail website</a>.  You can buy tickets online and then collect the tickets at the station, and it is often cheaper to buy advance tickets if you have fixed times.  However it is more flexible but more expensive to buy the tickets on the day at the station.  There is also a mysterious off-peak time which varies by station and means cheaper tickets, but expect to pay considerably higher prices if you are travelling during "rush hour" times (ie. arriving into London before 10am on a weekday).</p>
