won the toss and batted first in constant drizzle scoring a very tidy
144-3 built around a solid unbeaten Atwell innings of 48no, Maltravers
21, and Waites (though not the pony tailed star of many Biology matches
I'm informed) 24. All accompanied by a non stop commentary from Mendham
behind the stumps. <br>In reply Armitage went
						first ball LBW, but Mendham
						smashed a quickfire 51 and James 48. Allen the pick of the bowlers with
						4-26. 18 off&nbsp; 5 overs and Panthers were left needing 12 from 2
						overs. Levesley and Fazeel faced Waites.&nbsp; Tight bowling, and 8 needed off
						last 6 balls. 5 came from 3 deliveries then Fazeel run out for 20. Dot
						ball
						and only&nbsp; 2 came from the final delivery leaving Panthers, as in
						their last game
						of 2010, a despairing run short. PHEW.

						one result after Maudsley strikes a brutal 10 over 69, aided by Langton

						trouble, losing the opening pair cheaply to be 14-2. Holmes (25) and
						Pratt (16) settled the ship somewhat, but when both went relatively
						cheaply things started to look good for Smith and Nephew. Fortunately
						for Panthers, Saeed took up the challenge and swung lustily at many a
						ball, connecting often enough to make a sterling 43. He was ably
						supported by Haider (39). Their middle order partnership, together with
						a strong performance by Sundries (16), allowed Panthers to notch up
						148-6. Wickets were evenly shared by the S&amp;N bowlers, one each for 5 of
						the 6 bowlers.<br>
						In reply S&amp;N batted valiantly, with Milner top scoring on 27 and Hoskins
						making a useful 17, but the Panther bowling was too strong: Holmes
						3-10, Gent 2-6, Ferguson 2-19. Nonetheless, S&amp;N stayed the distance,
						finishing with 71-9.<br>
						The game was played in a very good spirit and enjoyed by all.</td>

PDP XI. With Shailesh building a patient 53n.o. and Ankor 44 it was
steady progress from 70-3 off the 1st ten overs. The 5 wickets were
shared, with an excellent catch from Charno but nobody managed to slow
down the rate. Chasing a total of that size you have to attack and
Alco's lost wickets regularly as they swung the bat. 34-3 became 55-6
and despite a flurry at the end Naylor took 3-1 to pick off the tail.
Karfoot 22 and Helliwell 18 the only 2 in double figures. Some
spectacular fielding made PDP look a useful unit and rumour has it that
Andy Wellings may yet strap on his pads for season 29.<br>

But the Chemists choose to bat first. An early breakthrough as Suleman
is out LBW at 7-1 but then it's all the new look Chemistry.&nbsp; Old
boy Salman fires 73 and along with Smits 26 and Hemsworth 32 n.o. the
total rises rapidly. In reply the Chemists rotate 8 bowlers and as so
often Abbas the pick of the batsman with 22, Toulmin 21 n.o. but never
near the asking rate. Suleman takes 3-9, the speedy Pickup 2-9 and
Hemsworth impressive with 1-1. Almost 3 hours long and only 1 catch.
Bizarre. 8 of the 11 wickets clean bowled.<br>
