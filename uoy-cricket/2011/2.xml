  <summary>Psychos bat first and despite a carefully built half century from Prendergast (52), finally superbly caught by Coleman, and 15 from Simpson. The rest fall away to leave Psychos with a just defendable total. Vinigrad the pick of the bowlers with 3-16, Grundy (0-13) and Maudsley keeping things tight and only Milner (0-26) taking any stick. In reply there is only one result after Maudsley strikes a brutal 10 over 69, aided by Langton with 26. Moreland does his best with 2-16 but it's all over in 13 overs.</summary>
