  <summary>PLONGÉ won the toss and batted first in constant drizzle scoring a very tidy 144-3 built around a solid unbeaten Atwell innings of 48no, Maltravers 21, and Waites (the very same pony tailed star of many Biology matches I'm informed) 24. All accompanied by a non stop commentary from Mendham behind the stumps.
In reply Armitage went first ball LBW, but Mendham smashed a quickfire 51 and James 48. Allen the pick of the bowlers with 4-26. 18 off  5 overs and Panthers were left needing 12 from 2 overs. Levesley and Fazeel faced Waites.  Tight bowling, and 8 needed off last 6 balls. 5 came from 3 deliveries then Fazeel run out for 20. Dot ball and only  2 came from the final delivery leaving Panthers, as in their last game of 2010, a despairing run short. PHEW.</summary>
