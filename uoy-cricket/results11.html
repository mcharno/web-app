won the toss and batted first in constant drizzle scoring a very tidy
144-3 built around a solid unbeaten Atwell innings of 48no, Maltravers
21, and Waites (the very same pony tailed star of many Biology matches
I'm informed) 24. All accompanied by a non stop commentary from Mendham
behind the stumps. <br>In reply Armitage went
						first ball LBW, but Mendham
						smashed a quickfire 51 and James 48. Allen the pick of the bowlers with
						4-26. 18 off&nbsp; 5 overs and Panthers were left needing 12 from 2
						overs. Levesley and Fazeel faced Waites.&nbsp; Tight bowling, and 8 needed off
						last 6 balls. 5 came from 3 deliveries then Fazeel run out for 20. Dot
						ball
						and only&nbsp; 2 came from the final delivery leaving Panthers, as in
						their last game

						Pratt (16) settled the ship somewhat, but when both went relatively
						cheaply things started to look good for Smith and Nephew. Fortunately
						for Panthers, Saeed took up the challenge and swung lustily at many a
						ball, connecting often enough to make a sterling 43. He was ably
						supported by Haider (39). Their middle order partnership, together with
						a strong performance by Sundries (16), allowed Panthers to notch up
						148-6. Wickets were evenly shared by the S&amp;N bowlers, one each for 5 of
						the 6 bowlers.<br>
						In reply S&amp;N batted valiantly, with Milner top scoring on 27 and Hoskins
						making a useful 17, but the Panther bowling was too strong: Holmes
						3-10, Gent 2-6, Ferguson 2-19. Nonetheless, S&amp;N stayed the distance,
						finishing with 71-9.<br>
						The game was played in a very good spirit and enjoyed by all.</td>

down the rate. Chasing a total of that size you have to attack and
Alco's lost wickets regularly as they swung the bat. 34-3 became 55-6
and despite a flurry at the end Naylor took 3-1 to pick off the tail.
Karfoot 22 and Helliwell 18 the only 2 in double figures. Some
spectacular fielding made PDP look a useful unit and rumour has it that
Andy Wellings may yet strap on his pads for season 29.<br>

boy Salman fires 73 and along with Smits 26 and Hemsworth 32 n.o. the
total rises rapidly. In reply the Chemists rotate 8 bowlers and as so
often Abbas the pick of the batsman with 22, Toulmin 21 n.o. but never
near the asking rate. Suleman takes 3-9, the speedy Pickup 2-9 and
Hemsworth impressive with 1-1. Almost 3 hours long and only 1 catch.

reflection. Neville Cardus (google him youngsters) once wrote that the
leg glance is the most beautiful stroke in cricket. Ankur plays it
sublimely especially against real pace and 2 of his shots off Suleman
were worth watching the whole game for. The other memorable moment was
the almost psychic premonition with which Salman moved across behind
Brannigan as he failed to hold on to another brutal delivery from
Pickup and held on to the ball just inches from the ground.<br>

like the only hittable bowler picked up 5-26 and after 20 overs it was
101-7. 5 bowled. <br>
&nbsp;In reply Suleman (59) and Lynam (37no) cut and pulled their way
to 94 in 15 overs. 2 late wickets left PLONGE with more of a smile.<br>

have won 3 games so far this season but beaten both of the top 2 sides
in the league. They put Chemistry in and bowled what could be best
described as tidily. But the Chemists could not get going at any sort
of rate. At one end Lynam rotated the strike but Alco's made 2
important strikes removing both the dangerous Salman and Suleman, both
LBW, both for just 8. After 10 overs it was only 33-2. Lee joined Lynam
and from 49 after 14 overs they managed to reach 3 figures just, 104-4
after 20 overs. Lynam 43 n.o. , Lee 21. Wills took 2-10, Honeywell 1-25
But Milstead with 0-12 off 4 and Mitchell with 1-17 off 4 really kept
the total down. Chemistry's strength this season has been their bowling
so they felt they were still in the game. Mitchell went early for 9 but
then Helliwell (46) and Charno (38 n.o.) attacked anything pitched up
and despite defensive fields Chemistry could not contain them, or get
them out. Lidster 1-25 was followed by Suleman 0-19 and Pickworth 0-17.
Alco's needed 23 off 4 overs and just made it with 3 balls to
spare.&nbsp; A well deserved win.<br>

finest of edges. Always the sports man. Haseeb manages a fine knock of
